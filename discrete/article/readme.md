# Readme

This directory contains all material related to the article contained therein on the subject of the [discrete geometric equation](Discrete_Geometric_Equation.md).

In the spirit of open science, all revisions of this work are hosted here on github. In principle it could be considered a permanent living document, though the aim is to work towards a stable version. At present, it may be considered to be under public review; and although it will forever stay that way, in the near term, substantial errors, and hopefully subsequent refinements, are to be expected.

We strive to have every figure linked in this work, to be generated by a self-contained unit-test in this repository. Insofar as we fall short of that ideal, please point it out in the issue tracker.

Reproducing this work requires cloning this repository, creating a python/poetry environment, and invoking the relevant pytest entrypoints. Absent those steps, one may still independently reproduce at least part of this work by clicking this [link](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mdjSWD).
