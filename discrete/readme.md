TODO
====
want multivector interop.
want the ability to set up good plane waves and so on

jax different outcomes; quite substantial?
need to get dual-leap mass term in there
its not a temporal action at a distance; though still spariall sus
doesnt work in 1d somehow?

want eigensolvr
at least give nonlinear a brief spin in new jax context
being able to get some form of soliton going would be so cool
try out variations in the speed of time?


what is the essence of the paper?
present the schem; present the mass term,
and show some cool pics.
that should be the basis
really dont want to get drawn in deeper...


wrt nonlinear; had more interesting results with quad terms; but dimensionall wrong
what about sqrt of squared terms? should be fine dimensionally.
same as some quadratic things we tried, but with abs, effectively. 
cross terms might have a minus; but we could abs-sqrt them.

need to get eigen solver up
then try it on an electron
lets make sure to leave it at that and move on

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Gordon_equation
sine-gordon looking rreally sweet. if we can get something liek that running,
awesome. if not for physics, at least for quntum pong.
those bound elastic states are amazing
havnt gotten very close yet though
