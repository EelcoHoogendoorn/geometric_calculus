TODO
====
want multivector interop.
want the ability to set up plane waves and so on

Implement eigensolver; preferaby using explitly periodic time axis

at least give nonlinear a brief spin in new jax context
being able to get some form of soliton going would be so cool
wrt nonlinear; had more interesting results with quad terms; but dimensionall wrong
what about sqrt of squared terms? should be fine dimensionally.
same as some quadratic things we tried, but with abs, effectively. 
cross terms might have a minus; but we could abs-sqrt them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Gordon_equation
sine-gordon looking really sweet. if we can get something like that running in nd awesome. if not for physics, at least for quntum pong. those bound elastic states are amazing; havnt gotten very close yet though
