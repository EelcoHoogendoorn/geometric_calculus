TODO
====
so much cleanup and unification... need some kind of clean way to compose code for pure geometric derivative timestepping, vs tacking on other terms, and folding metric variations in the object structure

want numga-multivector interop.
want the ability to set up plane waves and so on

Implement eigensolver; preferaby using explitly periodic time axis. got an mvp; but it is quite slow and brittle

at least give nonlinear a brief spin in new jax context
being able to get some form of soliton going would be so cool
wrt nonlinear; had more interesting results with quad terms; but dimensionally wrong

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Gordon_equation
sine-gordon looking really neat. if we can get something like that running in nd awesome. if not for physics, at least for quantum pong. those bound elastic states are amazing; havnt gotten very close yet though
