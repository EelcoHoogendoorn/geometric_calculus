This code is made available under a hard-copy-left academic license

A license is granted free of charge, conditional on the proactive publication of any derived works,
including all materials required for independent reproduction.

Note that the obligations incurred under this license imply a proactive duty to publish, for the authors of derived works to which this license is granted.
 * Restrictions on access based on 'reasonable use', affiliations, titles, or any other reason, are explicitly forbidden under the terms of this license.
 * Promises of future publication of code or data, are explicitly forbidden under the terms of this license.
 * Any monetary fees associated with uploading, hosting, or other costs of the process of making public, are to be the responsibility of the authors to which this license is granted.
 * This stands in contrast to applicable market rates for the downloading of data, as they may apply to large volumes thereof, which are excluded as a liability of those granted this license.
We emphasize 'applicable market rates'; any and all barriers erected to discriminate against downloading from the public links provided, are forbidden. This includes both positive and negative discrimination, however defined.

If the licensee is found in violation of the license, the licensees agrees to officially and publicly retract all publications that are considered derived works. The obligation to proactively retract extends to third party publishers or journals, working on collaboration with the licensee.


Clarification of terms
----------------------
Any 'publications' on the basis of the work contained here, trigger the obligations of this license.
Publication here is meant in the usual sense; a journal submission, conference presentation, project webpage; or any act intended to establish the derived work in the permanent public record.


By 'publishing code', a proactive duty is implied, to provide a self-contained whole, from raw data (where applicable), to numbers and figures or any other type of output supporting the claims in the derived work.
Code snippets, or code outside of context, that can not be run without additional external context, should not be viewed as a publication satisfying the requirement of this license.
Any dependencies of the code should be fully specified and available. Preferably free of charge, but proprietary software that is available for purchase without restrictions to the general public, are permissible under this license.

The ideal is to provide a repository of code, with an integrated continuous testing framework, forcing one to specify all steps to make the code run in a verifiable way.
Alternatively, a containerized image of an operating system including all dependencies can be a good method to ensure reproducible publication.
Alternatively, context appropriate dependency-managers are permitted, should they prove capable of creating an environment for reproducibly running the code.

Human-language instructions on how to setup, install, compile, or otherwise create an environment to run the code, are explicitly forbidden under the terms of this license, other than as a commentary on the automated steps provided.

Shortcomings of such dependency management, present and future, shall remain the responsibility of the licensee.
While it is not the responsibility of the licensee to make the code work on all hardware and software platforms,
if the author is unable to demonstrate reproducible steps to make the code run on at least one hardware and software platform, the license shall be considered revoked from that point onward, and any publications based on it shall be retracted.
Any verbal claims of the form 'it works on my machine', shall not be considered a demonstration, in the sense meant above.


Obviously all of this is super enforcable. Either way thanks for reading to the end.
Hopefully you didn't need this sermon, but if you did, its never too late to strive for redemption of your scientific soul.
